**Goals of the Book**

Data Science is a cross-disciplinary subject involving hands-on experience and business problem-solving exposures. The majority of existing introduction books in data science are about the modeling techniques and implementation using R or Python. However, they fail to introduce data science in a context of the industrial environment. Moreover, a crucial part, the art of data science in practice, is often missing. This book focuses on the hands-on and business problem-solving such that readers can quickly and easily transfer knowledge to real-world practice. 

Based on industry experience, this book outlines the real world scenario and points out pitfalls data science practitioners should avoid. It also covers big data cloud platform and the art of data science such as soft skills. We use R as the main tool and provide code for both R and Python.

**Our Target Audience**

This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to data science as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications and the reproducibility of the companion R and python code.

Readers should know basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.


**Key Features**

- Comprehensive: covers not only technical skills but also soft skills and big data environment in industry
- Hands-on using both R and Python
- Repeatable
- End-to-end cycle of a typical data science project
- Pitfalls that everyone should avoid


**Others**

- CRC Press
- Deadline: Dec 1, 2019
- Approximately 450 pages
- Color book

# To do:


Priority 1: 

- Tree model 
- Model error and tuning technique
- Model evaluation
- Feature engineering
- Regularized regression
- Regularized generalized regression
- Add Python Code
- Combine baby subsections
- Need to give more thoughts on how to blend with the case study. Refer to " Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving" by Nolan and Temple Lang.
- Add a “soft skills” section in each chapter which might break up the technical sequences and build on them in context.
- Make chapter 4 an appendix or later chapter. And change the topic to be high-performance computing (Hadoop and spark, etc., based on reviewer 3). The rapid changing of platforms and tools is a concern. 
- Chapter for clustering methods. 
- Provide dataset and code supplements for both R and Python using notebooks. 
- Accompany R package: https://github.com/happyrabbit/DataScienceR. 
- Clarify the prerequisite further.
- Clean the R packages that do the same thing. Only keep the current best practices.
- Need native English speakers to help us with the language and scaffolding. Adjust the scaffolding according to feedbacks as we move on. 


Priority 2:

- Social network and their application in industry 

    - Use Trump's Twitter data since 2016 as the case study.  
    - Include it tentatively in the table of contents, but then see how the rest of the book shapes up, before deciding whether to include it or not. 
    - The length of the book could be a concern. 
    
- Deep Learning and its application

Priority 3:
    
- Natural language processing
- Bayesian
