**Goals of the Book**

Data Science is a cross-disciplinary subject involving hands-on experience and business problem solving exposures. The majority of existing introduction books in data science are about the modeling techniques and how to implement those techniques using R or Python. However, they fail to introduce data science in a context of the industrial environment. Moreover, a crucial part, art of data science in practice, is often missing. This book focuses on the hands-on and business problem-solving such that readers can quickly and easily transfer knowledge to real-world practice. We also introduce the best
practices in industrial environments (such as big data cloud platform and soft skills) and the end-to-end business cycle of a typical data science project.

Based on industry experience, this book outlines the real world scenario and points
out pitfalls data science practitioners should avoid. It also covers big data cloud platform and the art of data science such as soft skills. We use R as the main tool and provide code for both R and Python.

**Our Target Audience**

Our target audiences are graduate students in STEM and statisticians, operation researchers or economists currently working at various industries, and anyone who want to apply data science.

**Key features of the book**

- Comprehensive: covers not only technical skills, but also soft skills and big data environment in
industry
- Hands on using both R and Python
- Repeatable
- End-to- end cycle of a typical data science project
- Pitfalls that everyone should avoid
