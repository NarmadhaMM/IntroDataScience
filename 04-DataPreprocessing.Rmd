# Data Pre-processing

Many data analysis related books focus on models, algorithms and statistical inferences. However, in practice, raw data is usually not directly used for modeling. Data preprocessing is the process of converting raw data into clean data that is proper for modeling. A model fails for various reasons. One is that the modeler doesn't correctly preprocess data before modeling. Data preprocessing can significantly impact model results, such as imputing missing value and handling with outliers. So data preprocessing is a very critical part.

In real life, depending on the stage of data cleanup, data has the following types:

1. Raw data
2. Technically correct data
3. Data that is proper for the model
4. Summarized data
5. Data with fixed format

The raw data is the first-hand data that analysts pull from the database, market survey responds from your clients,  the experimental results collected by the R & D department, and so on. These data may be very rough, and R sometimes can't read them directly. The table title could be multi-line, or the format does not meet the requirements:

- Use 50% to represent the percentage rather than 0.5, so R will read it as a character;
- The missing value of the sales is represented by "-" instead of space so that R will treat the variable as character or factor type;
-  The data is in a slideshow document, or the spreadsheet is not ".csv" but ".xlsx"
- ...

Most of the time, you need to clean the data so that R can import them. Some data format requires a specific package. Technically correct data is the data, after preliminary cleaning or format conversion, that R (or another tool you use) can successfully import it.   

Assume we have loaded the data into R with reasonable column names, variable format and so on. That does not mean the data is entirely correct. There may be some observations that do not make sense, such as age is negative, the discount percentage is greater than 1, or data is missing. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of problems with the data. It is necessary to clean the data before modeling. Moreover, different models have different requirements on the data. For example, some model may require the variables are of consistent scale; some may be susceptible to outliers or collinearity, some may not be able to handle categorical variables and so on. The modeler has to preprocess the data to make it proper for the specific model.

Sometimes we need to aggregate the data.  For example, add up the daily sales to get annual sales of a product at different locations.  In customer segmentation, it is common practice to build a profile for each segment. It requires calculating some statistics such as average age, average income, age standard deviation, etc. Data aggregation is also necessary for presentation, or for data visualization.

The final table results for clients need to be in a nicer format than what used in the analysis.  Usually, data analysts will take the results from data scientists and adjust the format, such as labels, cell color, highlight. It is important for a data scientist to make sure the results look consistent which makes the next step easier for data analysts. 

It is highly recommended to store each step of the data and the R code, making the whole process as repeatable as possible. The R markdown reproducible report will be extremely helpful for that. If the data changes, it is easy to rerun the process. In the remainder of this chapter, we will show the most common data preprocessing methods.

Load the R packages first:

```{r, message=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/CE_JSM2017/master/Rcode/00-course-setup.R")
```

## Data Cleaning

After you load the data, the first thing is to check how many variables are there, the type of variables, the distributions, and data errors. Let's read and check the data:

```{r}
sim.dat <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/DataScientistR/master/Data/SegData.csv ")
summary(sim.dat)
```

Are there any problems? Questionnaire response Q1-Q10 seem reasonable, the minimum is 1 and maximum is 5. Recall that the questionnaire score is 1-5. The number of store transactions (store_trans) and online transactions (store_trans) make sense too. Things need to pay attention are: 

- There are some missing values. 
- There are outliers for store expenses (`store_exp`). The maximum value is 50000. Who would spend $50000 a year buying clothes? Is it an imputation error? 
- There is a negative value ( -500) in `store_exp ` which is not logical. 
- Someone is 300 years old. 

How to deal with that? Depending on the real situation, if the sample size is large enough, it will not hurt to delete those problematic samples. Here we have 1000 observations. Since marketing survey is usually expensive,  it is better to set these values as missing and impute them instead of deleting the rows. 


```{r}
# set problematic values as missings
sim.dat$age[which(sim.dat$age>100)]<-NA
sim.dat$store_exp[which(sim.dat$store_exp<0)]<-NA
# see the results
summary(subset(sim.dat,select=c("age","income")))
```

Now we will deal with the missing values in the data.

## Missing Values

You can write a whole book about missing value. This section will only show some of the most commonly used methods without getting too deep into the topic. Chapter 7 of the book by De Waal, Pannekoek and Scholtus [@Ton2011] makes a concise overview of some of the existing imputation methods. The choice of specific method depends on the actual situation. There is no best way.

One question to ask before imputation:  Is there any auxiliary information? Being aware of any auxiliary information is critical.  For example, if the system set customer who did not purchase as missing, then the real purchasing amount should be 0.  Is missing a random occurrence? If so, it may be reasonable to impute with mean or median. If not, is there a potential mechanism for the missing data? For example, older people are more reluctant to disclose their ages in the questionnaire, so that the absence of age is not completely random. In this case, the missing values need to be estimated using the relationship between age and other independent variables. For example, use variables such as whether they have children, income, and other survey questions to build a model to predict age.

Also, the purpose of modeling is important for selecting imputation methods. If the goal is to interpret the parameter estimate or statistical inference, then it is important to study the missing mechanism carefully and to estimate the missing values using non-missing information as much as possible. If the goal is to predict,  people usually will not study the absence mechanism rigorously (but sometimes the mechanism is obvious). If the absence mechanism is not clear, treat it as missing at random and use mean, median, or k-nearest neighbor to impute. Since statistical inference is sensitive to missing values, researchers from survey statistics have conducted in-depth studies of various imputation schemes which focus on valid statistical inference. The problem of missing values in the prediction model is different from that in the traditional survey.  Therefore, there are not many papers on missing value imputation in the prediction model. Those who want to study further can refer to Saar-Tsechansky and Provost's comparison of different imputation methods [@missing1] and De Waal, Pannekoek and Scholtus' book [@Ton2011].

### Impute missing values with median/mode

In the case of missing at random, a common method is to impute with the mean (continuous variable) or median (categorical variables). You can use `impute()` function in `imputeMissings` package.

```{r}
# save the result as another object
demo_imp<-impute(sim.dat,method="median/mode")
# check the first 5 columns, there is no missing values in other columns
summary(demo_imp[,1:5])
```

After imputation, `demo_imp` has no missing value. This method is straightforward and widely used. The disadvantage is that it does not take into account the relationship between the variables. When there is a significant proportion of missing, it will distort the data. In this case, it is better to consider the relationship between variables and study the missing mechanism. In the example here, the missing variables are numeric. If the missing variable is a categorical/factor variable, the `impute()` function will impute with the mode.

You can also use `preProcess()` function, but it is only for numeric variables, and can not impute categorical variables. Since missing values here are numeric, we can use the `preProcess()` function. The result is the same as the `impute()` function. `PreProcess()`  is a powerful function that can link to a variety of data preprocessing methods.  We will use the function later for other data preprocessing.

```{r}
imp<-preProcess(sim.dat,method="medianImpute")
demo_imp2<-predict(imp,sim.dat)
summary(demo_imp2[,1:5])
```
