# About the Authors {-}

**Hui Lin** is currently Data Scientist at DowDuPont. She is a leader within the company at applying advanced data science to enhance Marketing and Sales effectiveness. She has been providing statistical leadership for a broad range of predictive analytics and market research analysis since 2013. She is the co-founder of Central Iowa R User Group, blogger of scientistcafe.com and program Chair of Statistics in Marketing Section of ASA for 2018. She enjoys making analytics accessible to a broad audience and teaches tutorials and workshops for practitioners on data science. 

She holds MS and Ph.D. in statistics from Iowa State University, BS in mathematical statistics from Beijing Normal University.

**Ming Li** is currently a Sr. Data Scientist at Amazon. He was Data Scientist at Wal-Mart and an Adjunct Faculty of Department and Marketing and Business Analytics in TAMU – Commerce. He is also the Chair of Quality & Productivity Section of ASA for 2016. He was a Statistical Leader at General Electric Global Research Center and Research Statistician at SAS Institute. He obtained his Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University at 2010. With deep statistics background and a few years’ experience in data science, he has trained and mentored numerous junior data scientist with different backgrounds such as statistics, computer science, and business analytics. 

# Preface {-}

## Goal of the Book {-}

This is an introduction book to data science with a specific focus on the application. Data Science is a cross-disciplinary subject involving hands-on experience and business problem-solving exposures. The majority of existing introduction books on data science are about the modeling techniques and the implementation of models using R or Python. However, they fail to introduce data science in a context of the industrial environment. Moreover, a crucial part, the art of data science in practice, is often missing. This book intends to fill the gap. 

Some key features of this book are as follows:

- It is comprehensive. It covers not only technical skills but also soft skills and big data environment in industry.

- It is hands-on. We provide the data and repeatable R and Python code. You can repeat the analysis in the book using the data and code provided. We also suggest you to perform the analyses with your own data whenever possible. You can only learn data science by doing it!

- It is based on context. We put methods in the context of industrial data science questions. 

- Where appropriate, we point you to more advanced materials on models to dive deeper

## Who this book is for {-}

Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications and the reproducibility of the companion R and python code.

Readers should know basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.

## What this book covers {-}

Based on industry experience, this book outlines the real world scenario and points out pitfalls data science practitioners should avoid. It also covers big data cloud platform and the art of data science such as soft skills. We use R as the main tool and provide code for both R and Python.
