# Preface{-}

During the first couple years of our career as data scientists, we were bewildered by all kinds of data science hype. There is a lack of definition of many basic terminologies such as "Big Data" and "Data Science."  How big is big?  If someone ran into you asked what data science was all about, what would you tell them?  What is the difference between the sexy role "Data Scientist" and the traditional "Data Analyst"? How suddenly came all kinds of machine algorithms? All those struck us as confusing and vague as real-world data scientists!  But we always felt that there was something real there. After applying data science for many years, we explored it more and had a much better idea about data science. And this book is our endeavor to make data science to a more legitimate field. 

## Goal of the Book {-}

This is an introductory book to data science with a specific focus on the application. Data Science is a cross-disciplinary subject involving hands-on experience and business problem-solving exposures. The majority of existing introduction books on data science are about the modeling techniques and the implementation of models using R or Python. However, they fail to introduce data science in a context of the industrial environment. Moreover, a crucial part, the art of data science in practice, is often missing. This book intends to fill the gap. 

Some key features of this book are as follows:

- It is comprehensive. It covers not only technical skills but also soft skills and big data environment in the industry.

- It is hands-on. We provide the data and repeatable R and Python code. You can repeat the analysis in the book using the data and code provided. We also suggest you perform the analyses with your data whenever possible. You can only learn data science by doing it!

- It is based on context. We put methods in the context of industrial data science questions. 

- Where appropriate, we point you to more advanced materials on models to dive deeper

## Who This Book Is For {-}

Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications and the reproducibility of the companion R and python code.

Readers should know basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.

## What This Book Covers {-}

Based on industry experience, this book outlines the real world scenario and points out pitfalls data science practitioners should avoid. It also covers big data cloud platform and the art of data science such as soft skills. We use R as the main tool and provide code for both R and Python.

# About the Authors {-}

**Hui Lin** is leading and building data science department at Netlify. Before Netlify, she was a Data Scientist at DuPont. She was a leader in the company of applying advanced data science to enhance Marketing and Sales Effectiveness. She provided data science leadership for a broad range of predictive analytics and market research analysis from 2013 to 2018. She is the co-founder of Central Iowa R User Group, blogger of scientistcafe.com and 2018 Program Chair of ASA Statistics in Marketing Section. She enjoys making analytics accessible to a broad audience and teaches tutorials and workshops for practitioners on data science (https://course2019.netlify.com/). She holds MS and Ph.D in statistics from Iowa State University.

**Ming Li** is currently a Senior Data Scientist at Amazon and an Adjunct Faculty of Department of Marketing and Business Analytics in Texas A&M University - Commerce. He is the Chair of Quality & Productivity Section of ASA for 2017. He was a Data Scientist at Walmart and a Statistical Leader at General Electric Global Research Center. He obtained his Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University at 2010. With deep statistics background and a few years’ experience in data science, he has trained and mentored numerous junior data scientist with different background such as statistician, programmer, software developer, database administrator and business analyst. He is also an Instructor of Amazon’s internal Machine Learning University and was one of the key founding member of Walmart’s Analytics Rotational Program which bridges the skill gaps between new hires and productive data scientists.
