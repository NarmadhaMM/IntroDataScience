# Tree-Based Methods

The tree-based models can be used for regression and classification. They are popular tools for many reasons: 

1. Do not require user to specify the form of the relationship between predictors and response
1. Do not require (or if they do, very limited) data preprocessing and can handle different types of predictors (sparse, skewed, continuous, categorical, etc.)
1. Robust to co-linearity
1. Can handle missing data
1. Many pre-built packages make implementation as easy as a button push
