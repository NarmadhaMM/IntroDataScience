Interest in data science is at an all-time high and has exploded in popularity in the last couple of years. Data scientists today are from various backgrounds. If someone ran into you ask what data science is all about, what would you tell them? It is not an easy question to answer. Data science is one of the areas that everyone is talking about, but no one can define. 

Media has been hyping about “Data Science” “Big Data” and “Artificial Intelligence” over the fast few years. I like this amusing  statement from the internet:

> “When you’re fundraising, it’s AI. When you’re hiring, it’s ML. When you’re implementing, it’s logistic regression.”

For outsiders, data science is whatever magic that can get useful information out of data. Everyone should have heard about big data. Data science trainees now need the skills to cope with such big data sets. What are those skills? You may hear about: Hadoop, a system using Map/Reduce to process large data sets distributed across a cluster of computers or about Spark, a system build atop Hadoop for speeding up the same by loading huge datasets into shared memory(RAM) across clusters. The new skills are for dealing with organizational artifacts of large-scale cluster computing but not for better solving the real problem. A lot of data means more tinkering with computers. After all, it isn’t the size of the data that’s important. It’s what you do with it.

Your first reaction to all of this might be some combination of skepticism and confusion. We want to address this up front that: we had that exact reaction. To declutter, let’s start with the fundamental question: what is data science?

## Blind men and an elephant

There is a widely diffused Chinese parable (depending on where you are from, you may think it is a Japanese parable) which is about a group of blind men conceptualizing what the elephant is like by touching it:

>  "...In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said: 'This being is like a thick snake'. For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, 'elephant is a wall'. Another who felt its tail described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear."  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)

Data science is the elephant. With the data science hype picking up stream, many professionals changed their titles to be “Data Scientist” without any of the necessary qualifications. Today's data scientists have vastly different backgrounds, yet each one conceptualizes what the elephant is based on his/her own professional training and application area. And to make matters worse, most of us are not even fully aware of our own conceptualizations, much less the uniqueness of the experience from which they are derived.
