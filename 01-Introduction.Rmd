# Introduction

Interest in data science is at an all-time high and has exploded in popularity in the last couple of years. Data scientists today are from various backgrounds. If someone ran into you ask what data science is all about, what would you tell them? It is not an easy question to answer. Data science is one of the areas that everyone is talking about, but no one can define. 

Media has been hyping about “Data Science” “Big Data” and “Artificial Intelligence” over the fast few years. I like this amusing  statement from the internet:

> “When you’re fundraising, it’s AI. When you’re hiring, it’s ML. When you’re implementing, it’s logistic regression.”

For outsiders, data science is whatever magic that can get useful information out of data. Everyone should have heard about big data. Data science trainees now need the skills to cope with such big data sets. What are those skills? You may hear about: Hadoop, a system using Map/Reduce to process large data sets distributed across a cluster of computers or about Spark, a system build atop Hadoop for speeding up the same by loading huge datasets into shared memory(RAM) across clusters. The new skills are for dealing with organizational artifacts of large-scale cluster computing but not for better solving the real problem. A lot of data means more tinkering with computers. After all, it isn’t the size of the data that’s important. It’s what you do with it. Your first reaction to all of this might be some combination of skepticism and confusion. We want to address this up front that: we had that exact reaction.

To declutter, let’s start from a brief history of data science. If you hit up the Google Trends website which shows search keyword information over time and check the term “data science,” you will find the history of data science goes back a little further than 2004. From the way media describes it, you may feel machine learning algorithms were just invented last month, and there was never "big" data before Google. That is not true. There are new and exciting developments of data science, but many of the techniques we are using are based on decades of work by statisticians, computer scientists, mathematicians and scientists of all types.

In the early 19th century when Legendre and Gauss came up the least squares method for linear regression, only physicists would use it to fit linear regression. Now, even non-technical people can fit linear regressions using excel. In 1936 Fisher came up with linear discriminant analysis. In the 1940s, we had another widely used model – logistic regression. In the 1970s, Nelder and Wedderburn formulated “generalized linear model (GLM)” which: 

> "generalized linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value." [from Wikipedia] 

By the end of the 1970s, there was a range of analytical models and most of them were linear because computers were not powerful enough to fit non-linear model until the 1980s.


## Blind men and an elephant

There is a widely diffused Chinese parable (depending on where you are from, you may think it is a Japanese parable) which is about a group of blind men conceptualizing what the elephant is like by touching it:

>  "...In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said: 'This being is like a thick snake'. For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, 'elephant is a wall'. Another who felt its tail described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear."  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)

Data science is the elephant. With the data science hype picking up stream, many professionals changed their titles to be “Data Scientist” without any of the necessary qualifications. Today's data scientists have vastly different backgrounds, yet each one conceptualizes what the elephant is based on his/her own professional training and application area. And to make matters worse, most of us are not even fully aware of our own conceptualizations, much less the uniqueness of the experience from which they are derived. Here is a list of somewhat whimsical definitions for a “data scientist”:

- “A data scientist is a data analyst who lives in California”
- “A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.”
- “A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco.”
- “Data Science is statistics on a Mac.”

It is annoying but true. So the answer to the question "what is data science?" depends on who you are talking to. Who you may be talking to then? Data science has three main skill tracks: engineering, analysis, and modeling (and yes, the order matters!).  Here are some representative skills in each track. Different tracks and combinations of tracks will define different roles in data science. [^1]

It is a collection of thoughts of different data scientist across industries about what a data scientist does, and what differentiates an exceptional data scientist.

- Engineering: the process of making everything else possible

You need to have the ability to get data before making sense of it. If you only deal with a small dataset, you may be able to get by with entering some numbers into a spreadsheet. As the data increasing in size, data engineering becomes a sophisticated discipline in its own right. 

Data engineering mainly involves in building the data pipeline infrastructure. In the (not that) old day,  when data is stored on local servers, computers or other devices, building the data infrastructure can be a humongous IT project which involves not only the software but also the hardware that used to store the data and perform ETL process. As the development of could service, data storage and computing on the cloud becomes the new norm. Data engineering today at its core is software engineering. Ensuring maintainability through modular, well-commented code and version control is fundamental.

1. Data management  
    Automated data collection is a common task which includes parsing the logs (depending on the stage of the company and the type of industry you are in), web scraping, API queries, and interrogating data streams. 

2. Production
    If you want to integrate the model or analysis into the production system, then you have to automate all data handling steps. It involves the whole pipeline from data access to preprocessing, modeling and final deployment. It is necessary to make the system work smoothly with all existing stacks. So it requires to monitor the system through some sort of robust measures, such as rigorous error handling, fault tolerance, and graceful degradation to make sure the system is running smoothly and the users are happy.

## Data Pipeline Infrastructure

Data pipeline infrastructure is the ecosystem data science lives in. As someone with math/statistics background, it can be challenging to understand and get used to the infrastructure.
