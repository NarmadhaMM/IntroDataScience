# Soft Skills for Data Scientists

## Comparison between Statistician and Data Scientist

Statistics as a scientific area can be traced back to 1749 and statistician as a career has been around for hundreds of years with well-established theory and application. Data Scientist becomes an attractive career for only a few years along with the fact that data size and variety beyond the traditional statistician’s toolbox and the fast-growing of computation power. Statistician and data scientist have a lot of in common, but there are also significant differences.

Both statistician and data scientist work closely with data. For the traditional statistician, the data is usually well-formatted text files with numbers and labels. The size of the data usually can be fitted in a PC’s memory. Comparing to statisticians, data scientists need to deal with more varieties of data: 

- well-formatted data stored in a database system with size much larger than a PC’s memory or hard-disk;
- huge amount of verbatim text, voice, image, and video;
- real-time streaming data and other types of records. 

One unique power of statistics is to make statistical inference based on a small set of data. Statisticians spend most of their time developing models and don't need to put too much effort on data cleaning. Today, data is relatively abundant, and modeling is only part of the overall effort, often a small part. Due to the active development of some open source communities, fitting models is not too far from button pushing. Data scientists instead spend lot of time preprocessing and wrangling the data before feeding them to the model. 

Different from statisticians, data scientists often focus on delivering actionable results and sometimes need to fit model on the cloud. The data can be too large to read in laptop.  From the entire problem-solving cycle, statisticians are usually not well integrated with the production system where data is obtained in real time; while data scientists are more embedded in the production system and closer to the data generation procedures.

## Beyond Data and Analytics

Data scientists usually have a good sense of data and analytics, but data scientist project is more than that. A data science project may involve people with different roles, especially in a big company:

- a business owner or leader to identify business value;
- program manager to ensure the data science project fits into the overall technical program development and coordinate all parties to set periodical tasks so that the project meets the preset milestones and results;
- data owner and computation resource and infrastructure owner from the IT department;
- dedicated team to make sure the data and model are under model governance and privacy guidelines;
- a team to implement, maintain and refresh the model;
- multiple rounds of discussion of resource allocation among groups (i.e., who pay for the data science project).

Effective communication and in-depth domain knowledge about the business problem are essential requirements for a successful data scientist. A data scientist may interact with people at various levels from senior leaders who set the corporate strategies to front-line employees who do the daily work. A data scientist needs to have the capability to view the problem from 10,000 feet above the ground, as well as down to the detail to the very bottom. To convert a business question into a data problem, a data scientist needs to communicate using the language the other people can understand and obtain the required information.

In the entire process of data science project defining, planning, executing and implementing, every step involves the data scientist to ensure people correctly define the business problem  and reasonably evaluate the business value and success. Corporates are investing heavily in data science and machine learning with a very high expectation of return. 

However, it is easy to set unrealistic goal and wrongly estimate the business impact. The data scientist lead should navigate the discussions to make sure the goal can be backed by data and analytics. Many data science projects over promise and are too optimistic on the timeline. These projects eventually fail by not delivering the preset business impact within the timeline. As data scientists, we need to identify these issues early in the stage and communicate with the entire team to make sure the project has a realistic deliverable and timeline. The data scientist team also need to work closely with data owners to identify relevant internal and external data source and evaluate the quality of the data; as well as working closely with the infrastructure team to understand the computation resources (i.e. hardware and software) available for the data science project.

## Three Pillars of Knowledge

The following picture summarizes the three pillars of knowledge needed for a successful data scientist. 

(1) A successful data scientist needs to have a strong technical background in data mining, statistics and machine learning. The in-depth understanding of modeling with the insight about data enable a data scientist to convert a business problem to a data science problem. 

(2) A successful data scientist needs some domain knowledge to understand business problem. For any data science project, the data scientist need to collaborate with other team members and effective communication and leadership skills are critical, especially when you are the only data person in the room and you need to decide with uncertainty. 

(3) The last pillar is about computation environment and model implementation in big data platform. This used to be the most difficult one for a data scientist with statistics background (i.e. lack computer science or programming skills). The good news is that with the rise of cloud computation big data platform, this barrier is getting easier for a statistician to overcome and we will discuss in more detail in next chapter.

## Common Pitfalls of Data Science Projects

Data science projects are usually complicated, and many of these data science projects eventually fail due to various reasons. We will briefly discuss a few common pitfalls in data science projects and how to avoid them.

- **Solve the wrong problem:** data science project usually starts with a very vague description and a few rounds of detailed discussion with all stakeholders involved are needed to define the busses problem. There will be lots of opportunities to introduce misalignment when mapping the business problem into specific data science methods. Especially when the quality and availability of the data are not as good as what is expected at the first place. If not well-communicated during the project, the final data science solution may not be the right one to solve the business problem. As the data scientist (sometimes the only data scientist) in the room, we must understand the business problem thoroughly and communicate regularly to business partners especially there is a change of status to make sure everyone is aligned with the progress and final deliverables.

- **Over promise on business value:** business leaders usually have high expectation on data science projects and the goal of business value and deliverables sometimes are set unrealistic and eventually beyond the scope of available data and computation resource.  As the data scientist (sometimes the only data scientist) in the room, we must have our voice heard based on fact (i.e. data, analytics, and resources) instead of wishful thinking. Backed with fact-based evidence, it is easier to communicate what is a realistic goal for the entire team. 

- **Too optimistic about the timeline:** there are lots of uncertainties in data science projects such as the data source availability and data quality, computation hardware and software, resource availability in the business team, implementation team and IT department, as well as project direction change which may delay the final delivery date. To have a better-estimated timeline, get as much detail as possible for all the needed tasks and estimated each task individually and reach out to each team member to confirm their availability. Most importantly, communicate with the entire team if there are blocking factors for the project in a prompt way such that everyone aware of the situation and potential impact on the timeline.

- **Too optimistic about data availability and quality:** the most important asset in data science project is data. Even though we are at the big data age, often there is not enough relevant data for the data science projects. The data quality is also a general problem for data science projects. A thorough data availability and quality check are needed at the beginning of the data science project to estimate the needed effort to obtain data as well as data cleaning. 

- **Model cannot be scaled:**  be careful if you use a subset of data to fit the model and then scale it to the entire dataset. When developing the model using a smaller dataset, we must keep in mind how much computation resources needed for the whole dataset. With limited computation resource, it is important to maximize the computation time in production to a reasonable level based on the business application when fits the model with a sample dataset. 

- **Take too long to fail:** data science projects usually are trying to push the boundary of current applications to new territory, people do not expect all data science projects to be successful. Fail fast is good practice such that we can quickly find a better way to solve the problem. A data scientist needs to have an open mindset to not stuck with one idea or one approach for a long time to avoid taking too long to fail.
