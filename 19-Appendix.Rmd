# Big Data Cloud Platform

## How Data becomes Science?

Data has been statistician's friend for hundreds of years. Tabulated data are the most familiar format that we use daily. People used to store data on papers, tapes, diskettes, or hard drives. Only recently, with the development of the computer, hardware, software, and algorithms, the volume, variety, and speed of the data suddenly beyond the capacity of a traditional statistician. And data becomes a special science with the very first focus on a fundamental question: with a huge amount of data, how can we store the data and quick access and process the data. In the past a few years, by utilizing commodity hardware and open source software, a big data ecosystem was created for data storage, data retrieval, and parallel computation. Hadoop and Spark have become a popular platform that enables data scientist, statistician, and business analyst to access the data and to build models. Programming skills in the big data platform have been the largest gap for a statistician to become a successful data scientist. However, with the recent wave of cloud computing, this gap is significantly reduced. Many of the technical details have been pushed to the background, and the user interface becomes much easier to learn.  Cloud systems also enable quick implementation to the production environment. Now data science is emphasis more on the data itself as well as models and algorithms on top of the data instead of platform and infrastructure. 

## Power of Cluster of Computers

We are all familiar with our laptop/desktop computers which contain mainly three components to finish computation with data: (1) Hard disk, (2) Memory, and (3) CPU as shown in Figure 41 left. The data and codes are stored in the hard disk which has certain features such as relatively slow for reading and writes and relatively large capacity of around a few TB in today’s market. Memory is relatively fast for reading and writing but relatively small in capacity in the order of a few dozens of GB in today’s market. CPU is where all the computation is done.

</center>

For statistical software such as R, the amount of data that it can process is limited by the computer’s memory. For a typical computer before the year 2000, the memory is less than 1 GB. The memory capacity grows far slower than the availability of the data to analyze. Now it is quite often that we need to analyze data far beyond the capacity of a single computer’s memory, especially in an enterprise environment. Meanwhile, the computation time is growing faster than linear to solve the same problem (such as regressions) as the data size increases.  Using a cluster of computers become a common way to solve big data problem. In Figure 41 (right), a cluster of computers can be viewed as one powerful machine with total memory, hard disk and CPU equivale to the sum of individual computers. It is common to have thousands of nodes for a cluster. 


In the past, to use a cluster of computers, users must write code (such as MPI) to take care of how data is distributed and how the computation is done in a parallel fashion. Luckily with the recent new development, the cloud environment for big data analysis is more user-friendly. As data is typically beyond the size of one hard disk, the dataset itself is stored across different nodes’ hard disk (i.e. the Hadoop system mentioned below). When we perform analysis, we can assume the needed data is already distributed across many node’s memories in the cluster and algorithm are parallel in nature to leverage corresponding nodes’ CPUs to compute (i.e. the Spark system mentioned below). 

### Evolution of Clustering Computing

Using computer clusters to solve general purpose data and analytics problems needs a lot of efforts if we have to specifically control every element and steps such as data storage, memory allocation, and parallel computation. Fortunately, high tech IT companies and open source communities have developed the entire ecosystem based on Hadoop and Spark. Users need only to know high-level scripting language such as Python and R to leverage computer clusters’ storage, memory and computation power.   

### Hadoop

The very first problem internet companies face is that a lot of data has been collected and how to better store these data for future analysis. Google developed its own file system to provide efficient, reliable access to data using large clusters of commodity hardware. The open source version is known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Both systems use Map-Reduce to allocate computation across computation nodes on top of the file system. Hadoop in written in Java and writing map-reduce job using Java is a direct way to interact with Hadoop which is not familiar to many in the data and analytics community. To help better use Hadoop system, an SQL-like data warehouse system called Hive, and a scripting language for analytics interface called Pig were introduced for people with analytics background to interact with Hadoop system. Within Hive, we can create user defined function through R or Python to leverage the distributed and parallel computing infrastructure. Map-reduce on top of HDFS is the main concept of the Hadoop ecosystem. Each map-reduce operation requires retrieving data from hard disk, computation time, and then storing the result onto disk again. So, jobs on top of Hadoop require a lot of disk operation which may slow down the computation process.

### Spark

Spark works on top of distributed file system including HDFS with better data and analytics efficiency by leveraging in-memory operations and is more tailored for data processing and analytics. The spark system includes an SQL-like framework called Spark SQL and a parallel machine learning library called MLib. Fortunately for many in the analytics community, Spark also supports R and Python. We can interact with data stored in distributed file system using parallel computing across nodes easily with R and Python through the Spark API and do not need to worry about lower level details of distributed computing. We will introduce how to use R notebook to drive Spark computations.

# R code for data simulation

## Customer Data for Clothing Company

The simulation is not very straightforward and we will break it into three parts: 

1. Define data structure: variable names, variable distribution, customer segment names, segment size
1. Variable distribution parameters: mean and variance
1. Iterate across segments and variables. Simulate data according to specific parameters assigned

By organizing code this way, it makes easy for us to change specific parts of the simulation. For example, if we want to change the distribution of one variable, we can just change the corresponding part of the code.

Here is code to define data structure:

```r
# set a random number seed to make the process repeatable
set.seed(12345)
# define the number of observations
ncust<-1000
# create a data frmae for simulated data
seg_dat<-data.frame(id=as.factor(c(1:ncust)))
# assign the variable names
vars<-c("age","gender","income","house","store_exp","online_exp","store_trans","online_trans")
# assign distribution for each variable
vartype<-c("norm","binom","norm","binom","norm","norm","pois","pois")
# names of 4 segments
group_name<-c("Price","Conspicuous","Quality","Style")
# size of each segments
group_size<-c(250,200,200,350)
```

The next step is to define variable distribution parameters. There are 4 segments of customers and 8 parameters. Different segments correspond to different parameters. Let's store the parameters in a 4×8 matrix:


```r
# matrix for mean
mus <- matrix( c(
  # Price
  60, 0.5, 120000,0.9, 500,200,5,2,
  # Conspicuous
  40, 0.7, 200000,0.9, 5000,5000,10,10,
  # Quality
  36, 0.5, 70000, 0.4, 300, 2000,2,15,
  # Style
  25, 0.2, 90000, 0.2, 200, 2000,2,20), ncol=length(vars), byrow=TRUE)
```

```r
# matrix for variance
sds<- matrix( c(
  # Price
  3,NA,8000,NA,100,50,NA,NA,
  # Conspicuous
  5,NA,50000,NA,1000,1500,NA,NA,
  # Quality
  7,NA,10000,NA,50,200,NA,NA,
  # Style
  2,NA,5000,NA,10,500,NA,NA), ncol=length(vars), byrow=TRUE)
```

Now we are ready to simulate data using the parameters defined above:

```r
# simulate non-survey data
sim.dat<-NULL
set.seed(2016)
# loop on customer segment (i)
 for (i in seq_along(group_name)){
 
   # add this line in order to moniter the process
   cat (i, group_name[i],"\n")
 
  # create an empty matrix to store relevent data
  seg<-data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=group_size[i], ncol=length(vars)))  
 
  # Simulate data within segment i
  for (j in seq_along(vars)){
 
    # loop on every variable (j)
    if (vartype[j]=="norm"){
      # simulate normal distribution
      seg[,j]<-rnorm(group_size[i], mean=mus[i,j], sd=sds[i,j])
    } else if (vartype[j]=="pois") {
      # simulate poisson distribution
      seg[,j]<-rpois(group_size[i], lambda=mus[i,j])
    } else if (vartype[j]=="binom"){
      # simulate binomial distribution
      seg[,j]<-rbinom(group_size[i],size=1,prob=mus[i,j])
    } else{
      # if the distribution name is not one of the above, stop and return a message
      stop ("Don't have type:",vartype[j])
    }        
  }
  sim.dat<-rbind(sim.dat,seg)
 }
```

Now let's edit the data we just simulated a little by adding tags to 0/1 binomial variables:

```r
# assign variable names
names(sim.dat)<-vars
# assign factor levels to segment variable
sim.dat$segment<-factor(rep(group_name,times=group_size))
# recode gender and house variable
sim.dat$gender<-factor(sim.dat$gender, labels=c("Female","Male"))
sim.dat$house<-factor(sim.dat$house, labels=c("No","Yes"))
# store_trans and online_trans are at least 1
sim.dat$store_trans<-sim.dat$store_trans+1
sim.dat$online_trans<-sim.dat$online_trans+1
# age is integer
sim.dat$age<-floor(sim.dat$age)
```

In the real world, the data always includes some noise such as missing, wrong imputation. So we will add some noise to the data:

```r
# add missing values
idxm <- as.logical(rbinom(ncust, size=1, prob=sim.dat$age/200))
sim.dat$income[idxm]<-NA
# add wrong imputations and outliers
set.seed(123)
idx<-sample(1:ncust,5)
sim.dat$age[idx[1]]<-300
sim.dat$store_exp[idx[2]]<- -500
sim.dat$store_exp[idx[3:5]]<-c(50000,30000,30000)
```

So far we have created part of the data. You can check it using `summary(sim.dat)`. Next, we will move on to simulate survey data.

```r
# number of survey questions
nq<-10
# mean matrix for different segments 
mus2 <- matrix( c(
  # Price
 5,2,1,3,1,4,1,4,2,4,
  # Conspicuous
 1,4,5,4,4,4,4,1,4,2,
  # Quality
 5,2,3,4,3,2,4,2,3,3,
  # Style
 3,1,1,2,4,1,5,3,4,2), ncol=nq, byrow=TRUE)

# assume the variance is 0.2 for all
sd2<-0.2
sim.dat2<-NULL
set.seed(1000)
# loop for customer segment (i)
for (i in seq_along(group_name)){
  # the following line is used for checking the progress
  # cat (i, group_name[i],"\n")
  # create an empty data frame to store data
  seg<-data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=group_size[i], ncol=nq))  
  # simulate data within segment
  for (j in 1:nq){
    # simulate normal distribution
    res<-rnorm(group_size[i], mean=mus2[i,j], sd=sd2)
    # set upper and lower limit
    res[res>5]<-5
    res[res<1]<-1
    # convert continuous values to discrete integers
    seg[,j]<-floor(res)
  }
  sim.dat2<-rbind(sim.dat2,seg)
}

names(sim.dat2)<-paste("Q",1:10,sep="")
sim.dat<-cbind(sim.dat,sim.dat2)
sim.dat$segment<-factor(rep(group_name,times=group_size))
```
